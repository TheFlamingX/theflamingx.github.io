                    <p>I made this page to see how linking works</p>
                    <p>
                        But in the process of making this page, I realized that I have no ability to syncronize things like the header. I'd have to update every single page. The first thing that came to my mind, in terms of fixing it, would be to define all that stuff in a single JavaScript file, and then only need to include that file. But I'd have to learn JavaScript.

                        Ignoring site stuff, I really like Weezer. They're the main band I listen to. My favorite album of theirs is Pinkerton, though I like all the stuff they make, even the new stuff. I really wish that their cover of "<a href="https://www.weezerpedia.com/w/index.php?title=I_Woke_Up_in_Love_This_Morning">I Woke Up in Love This Morning</a>" was on streaming services. I also really like ABBA, but signifcantly less than I like Weezer. I've been trying to get into Red Hot Chili Peppers recently, and it's kinda alright. There's also a lot of Toby Fox.

                        I think that I could get into any artist if I listened to them enough, but I'm sort of cool with what I listen to now.
