                        This is my blog. I don't know how often I'll update it, but it's good practice to keep my HTML and CSS skills sharp. Plus it gives me something to show for all the thinking I do.

                        I went rock climbing a few days ago, and it was a lot of fun. I plan to continue rock climbing in the future. However, my body is very sore because of it, even now. I used muscles that I don't normally use. I really feel it when I do stuff like take off my backpack, since that uses muscles I don't normally use.

                        I'm also working on getting familar with Unity. In the past, I've used Roblox Studio to try and make stuff (because I grew up with Roblox and it solves a lot of daunting problems in beginner game development), but I realized that what I was making could just as well be made in Unity. There is the issue of making my game known if I finish it, but that's a big if. Game development is hard and I don't have many extrinsic motivators.

                    <p>
                        Which in of itself, was of another reason I switched to Unity. Making half a game in Roblox Studio doesn't mean much, but making half a game in Unity shows I know my way around a professional tool.

                    <!-- Entry 1 -->
                    <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
                    <p>I've forgotten a few of the tags I used to use...</p>
                    <p>
                        I used to do a bunch of wiki stuff (like Wikipedia), which is pretty heavily influenced by HTML and CSS. I was able to accure a large amount of knowledge regarding HTML and CSS, so I know enough to put together a website by just straight up writing HTML and CSS in VSCode (boom <a href="music.html">link</a>). I don't have any knowledge about JavaScript, at least in regard as to modify a webpage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyways, I finally decided to put that knowledge to really cool use by making a website and putting it on GitHub. I also wanted to figure out how GitHub works, since so many programmer resources I use can connect to GitHub, so I figured it was finally time to figure it outs (I'm in college btw).
