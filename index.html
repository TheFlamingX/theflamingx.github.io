                        This is my blog. I don't know how often I'll update it, but it's good practice to keep my HTML and CSS skills sharp. Plus it gives me something to show for all the thinking I do.

                        Stoics have got it all figured out. Out of all the philosophical idealogies of the past, I find I agree with stoics the most. I think that happiness is found within oneself, and that staking your happiness on something that is beyond your control is a path to unhappiness.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content__quote">
                        "It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, if your happiness is determined by that which you do not have, then happiness will be a difficult pursuit. If one's happiness is determined by what they do have, then it will be far less of a challenge.

                        Anyways, in a hard pivot of subject: Death Note. I recently reread it and it's a great story. The spin-off stories are also fantastic. But I was thinking about why Light did what he did. I think that Light has two motivators for what he does: one intrinsic and one extrinsic. The extrinsic motivator is made obvious: it's the pursuit of a new world, in which crime is a thing of the past. But I think the intrinsic moitivator is more important for Light as a character: the thrill of getting away with it. This is what he means when Light says "I was bored, too..." at the start of the series (and is flash-backed to at the end of the series).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something that I think is sort of interesting about Death Note, that I don't feel like is discussed to a large degree, is Light's philosphy. We get bits and pieces of it at the start, but in some of the last chapters Light drops a few walls of text about it, and it's kinda cool. Basically, Light's justice revolves around the pursuit of happiness, and the prevention of it. Those who stop others' pursuit of happiness are immoral. Those who pursue their happiness are moral. Obviously, his methods are extreme, but beyond that, it's very simple.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Death Note is a great series for literary analysis.

                        I went rock climbing a few days ago, and it was a lot of fun. I plan to continue rock climbing in the future. However, my body is very sore because of it, even now. I used muscles that I don't normally use. I really feel it when I do stuff like take off my backpack, since that uses muscles I don't normally use.

                        I'm also working on getting familar with Unity. In the past, I've used Roblox Studio to try and make stuff (because I grew up with Roblox and it solves a lot of daunting problems in beginner game development), but I realized that what I was making could just as well be made in Unity. There is the issue of making my game known if I finish it, but that's a big if. Game development is hard and I don't have many extrinsic motivators.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which in of itself, was of another reason I switched to Unity. Making half a game in Roblox Studio doesn't mean much, but making half a game in Unity shows I know my way around a professional tool.

                        I used to do a bunch of wiki stuff (like Wikipedia), which is pretty heavily influenced by HTML and CSS. I was able to accure a large amount of knowledge regarding HTML and CSS, so I know enough to put together a website by just straight up writing HTML and CSS in VSCode (boom <a href="music.html">link</a>). I don't have any knowledge about JavaScript, at least in regard as to modify a webpage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyways, I finally decided to put that knowledge to really cool use by making a website and putting it on GitHub. I also wanted to figure out how GitHub works, since so many programmer resources I use can connect to GitHub, so I figured it was finally time to figure it outs (I'm in college btw).
