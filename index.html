                        I used to do a bunch of wiki stuff (like Wikipedia), which is pretty heavily influenced by HTML and CSS. I was able to accure a large amount of knowledge regarding HTML and CSS, so I know enough to put together a website by just straight up writing HTML and CSS in VSCode (boom <a href="music.html">link</a>). I don't have any knowledge about JavaScript, at least in regard as to modify a webpage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyways, I finally decided to put that knowledge to really cool use by making a website and putting it on GitHub. I also wanted to figure out how GitHub works, since so many programmer resources I use can connect to GitHub, so I figured it was finally time to figure it outs (I'm in college btw).
