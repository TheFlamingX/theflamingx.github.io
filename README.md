## What is this for?
I've never used GitHub before, so I'm trying it out with a website that I plan to use as a blog. I suppose I don't have an audience for the blog, but that just makes it a diary.
## What will you do with it?
Learning JavaScript would be very fun, and if I did I could make games that I'd be able to fully realize. That's very appealing to me, but it's contingent on me learning JavaScript, so idk. Check my blog for status updates on that.
## Why is [thing] so bad?
I'm learning as I go. If I'm doing something wrong, I'd genuinely love it if I could be told what it is. I guess it'd be put in the issues tab of this respository? As I said, learning as I go.
